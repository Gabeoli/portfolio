    "stamp": {
        "overview":"Stamp is a mobile app which mixes gamification with running within the real world. Players will go head to head with other players using running to capture, control and protect areas around the world. ",

        "problem": "Many people find difficulty when starting to train and while running is one of the most basic forms of exercise, they also lack the motivation or find it boring. When starting training, nowadays, it seems to revolve around a gym which requires a motivation itself to stay committed to, could cost a lot and could be disinteresting to a beginner. General training goals are to be healthier and fitter but beginners also have no idea how to track if they are improving.",

        "users": "Stamp is aimed at people looking to get a start at running and improve their health and fitness. The primary user would be young digital natives from age 18 - 30's who have a grasp on technology and use it constantly as a part of their lifestyle.",

        "roles":"My roles during this project included research, branding, user experience and designing the prototype.\nThe process started with the research which included questionnaires to the target demographic such as the amount of running they do a week,  whether they enjoy running and how technology plays a part with their running. Case studies of fitness tracking apps were also conducted to see understand links on what makes a successful tracking app.\nBased on the research, I learnt that many people are impatient and want to see results instantly, by then creating their secondary goals (the gamification)  as their primary goals, people are more likely to want to do the tasks as it's enjoyable.\nKnowing more about the target demographic and successful apps, the branding and app architecture could be created, leading into the creation of the wireframes then finally the prototype.",

        "challenges": "As the brief was to create something that incorporates health and wellbeing into a digital experience, the idea of Stamp was difficult to come up with. The idea came through deciding what can be gamified, figuring out that running was one of the simplest ways to exercise, something could be easily incorporated with it. The research was also very challenging as many I needed to figure out the technology to make it work to have it be working if it were to be developed. Case studies helped with this as existing running apps were the foundation of Stamp with a gamified twist.",

        "outcome": "The outcome of this project is when you learn more about the target audience the more you can cater to their needs, research goes a long way in order to create an ideal user experience. Learning that many people find training for fitness boring opened a new genre of gamification within the fitness industry where having different, entertaining goals that are different from their fitness goals improves motivations."

    "okoach": {
        "overview":"Okoach is an online coaching mobile app aimed towards the elite level of coaching or the average gym-goer. The app allows coaches to create, edit and distribute training programmes to their athletes while their athlete can track their training programme through the app. This was my final year project for university.",

        "problem": "The problem for coaches looking to expand through online means is the ability to organise their training programmes for their athletes. Many online coaches have the technology to do this however they use tools that they already know such as Excel spreadsheets, word documents, or designed PDFs to showcase their training programme and send via email or online-messenger. This snowballs into even more disorganisation where multiple athletes will respond via different forms of communication making it harder for the coach to stay on top of things, imagine having 100 athletes.",

        "users": "The primary user would be a coach or personal trainer that is already trying branch out into the world of online coaching. They would have an understanding of technology and familiarity with using mobile apps and would their lifestyle would revolve around the fitness industry. The secondary user would be the athlete, also a digital native with a familiarity of using mobile apps and both using online messaging as a form of communication. Lastly, another secondary user would be the average gym-goer looking for something new within their training.",

        "roles":"The roles I undertook when creating Okoach was the research, branding, user experience, interaction designer and developer.\nTo begin, research about the target demographic was done which included surveys with athletes, interviews with coaches who are currently providing online coaching, academic research papers to learn more about motivation within the fitness industry and case studies of popular training apps.\nOnce the research has been done, this allowed me to create the branding the logo, colours and typography. I could then also produce the app architecture to understand how the user would get to their goals of creating their training programmes and following their training programmes. This then led into the wireframes to visualise how the user would interact with the app and was then used into user testing to make improvements with the design.\nAfter improving the user interface within the wireframes, this was then converted into a high-fidelity mock-up to be used as a reference when developing. To develop React Native was used as I have a familiarity of Javascript when working on websites in previous projects. Developing consisted of breaking down the functionality of each screen through flow diagrams and then translating that into a functioning app.",

        "challenges":"Due to the challenges of not fully understanding React Native and learning while building it was difficult to accomplish exactly how I wanted some functionality to work. This meant that it took a lot of time understanding how to do something then implementing it within the app which occasionally led to it not functioning then learning something else in order to fix it. This meant the end result was incomplete but worked more like a prototype rather than a functioning app.",

        "outcome": "The outcome from a design and user experience perspective is that the research definitely determined the outcome. I believe that the design was suitable for the target demographic and user experienced flowed in order for them to reach their goals. The development of the app was incomplete due to time restraints and learning curves, however, what has produced a top-level high fidelity prototype which helped me understand the basics of creating mobile apps within React Native and improving my Javascript development."

    "hsbc": {
        "overview":"HSBC Private Banking, an app aimed for the new generation of wealth. HSBC's already existing private banking clientele are elder generation, used to doing things through the phone or in person whereas the new generation are those inherting their families wealth with a grasp with todays technology. The designed private banking app takes the needs and functionality of the already exisiting private banking business, with the needs of the future generation. This was a live brief as part of a module during my final year at university.",

        "problem": "The currently problem with online banking is that it hasn't caught up to todays technology with having everything between our fingertips. The current way private banking works is being in contact with a team of advisors from different departments of the bank who help with managing and investing your money. Currently, the means to do this is in person at a branch or through the phone which isn't ideal in todays generation where everything needs to be instant.",

        "users": "The primary users are the new generation of wealth who are digital natives. Their families could already be using HSBC's private banking and as a way to retain that loyalty, HSBC requires to keep up with todays technology through the app. The secondary users are the financial advisors at HSBC, being able to use the app to be in immediate contact with their client.",

        "roles":"For this project I did research into how the private banking realms and the needs and goals of someone that uses it. This meant researching about the potential users, learning about how competitors are approaching apps with private banking and case studies of exisiting banking apps.\nTo decide what features were added into the app, I created a brainstorm based on the research that was done. This helped decide the flow of the app and helped understand the priorities of the user. Wireframes were then created to help shape the direction of the design.\nAfter creating the wireframes I was able to use the already exisitng branding guidelines with my personal take on how the app design should look like as a prototype.",

        "challenges":"As private banking has such a niche demographic, it was up to the research and putting myself into the shoes of someone that would need a private banking app. This was challenging as it was hard to relate to someone with elite wealth, making it difficult to decide the features needed, the goals of the user and testing. However, the case studies done helped understand a general idea of private banking and the common goals for users from the competing companies. ",

        "outcome": "The outcome of the project gave me insight to the fintech world and how   many companies aim to transition from paper to digital. I also learnt that many times I will not be able to put myself in a position of empathy as my life experiences are vastly different from the desired user, however, with the right research and problem solving, I can produce possible goals which can aid in the decision making of the user experience and design."

    "ember": {
        "overview":"Ember is an app which aids the search for clinical trials by allowing doctors to post listings similar to a jobs board website. The app interviews patients seeking clinical trails to help narrow down the search results for the clinical trials available to them. Doctors and clinics will be able to get in contact with patients that are suitable for their clinical trial through Ember and stay in touch during the whole process. This was a group project, part of a live brief during my second year at university.",

        "problem": "Patients looking for treatment often find it difficult though regular google searches, there is generally not one place specifically to show all the available clinical trials in the world. Likewise, for clinics and doctors, they may not be able to reach potential patients that could use their help from regular means of searching. The current way of finding out clinical trials was through referrals and word of mouth from local doctors, but the problem with this is that patients would never be certain to be accepted for the clinical trial meaning they could be making the journey to these clinics only to find they aren't suitable.",

        "users": "Primary users include patients currently with an illness difficult to cure looking for clinical trials that may help with their illnesses. Ideally, the app would aid them with their search however if they are unable to do so, the next users would either be a carer, nurse or doctor helping them with the search. The other main user would-be doctors and clinics that will be conducting clinical trials. Both these users will be in contact to help determine if they are a fit for the trial and any help patients require during the process.",

        "roles":"During this project I worked with two other whos roles were the project manager and head of branding, while my role was UX designer. Working closely with both team members we worked on the understanding the users by creating personas matching the description of the brief. From here the head of branding could then begin creating appropriate brand guidelines which we can then use when we produce the prototype. The project manager and I worked together to create the app map to understand the flow of both perspectives, patient and doctor, this led to a decision to tailor both experiences differently for the patient and doctor. Once figuring out each user flow through the app, wireframes were made and then converted into the prototype.",

        "challenges":"The main challenge was figuring the needs of someone looking for a clinical trial, as it is a sensitive topic we could not do interviews with the target demographic, this was overcome by assuming the general needs of someone looking for a clinical trial. The assumed goals made were being in contact with doctors, the distance of clinics and to know the details about the clinical trials.",

        "outcome": "As a team, we worked together well, staying in communication with each other during the process of the project and meeting up regularly to decide how the overall app would work. The produced branding paired with the UX we made was empathetic to the possible users. I learned that communication is a key part of teamwork and that key decisions about the project were discussed in unison before applying them."

    "pocketlearner": {
        "overview":"Pocket Learner is an app that aims to teach children with learning difficulties how to read, write and speak. Pocket Learner was originally a physical book game which uses cue cards written with nouns and images to help children remember the words, usually played while accompanied by a teacher or parent. There are three stages, the first shows an image of something, for example, fruit, where the student tries to say the name of the object. The second stage shows the text of the object with the image to help the student associate the word with the object and understand the pronunciation. The last step shows just the word with hints that show the image. All three stages have a voice recording of which students can playback to hear how the word sounds like.",

        "problem": "The brief was to turn this physical tool into something digital and accessible for everyone. This meant understanding the needs and goals of the multiple users and also re-branding to make it more approachable for children. The main problem Pocket Learner tackles are aiding kids with learning difficulties to read and write, however, the current way always requires a teacher or carer to help them.",

        "users": "Primary users would be the child with learning difficulties, aged around 3-9 years old. Ideally, the secondary user would be their teacher and parent that helps them during their learning, however, the app plans to give the children independence so the UX will be catered towards them.",

        "roles":"The responsibilities I had during this project were the branding, user experience and final design. Before starting anything to do with the app, the original brand was re-designed as the logo was originally a painting which looked data and did not resonate with the target audience. Based on the brief, we were given an understanding of how the original pocket learner works which helped layout the user flow and user goals. The process would then start through the creation of wireframes, to determine the layout of the app where I aimed to create it simple enough for children to use, adding large buttons and minimal text to help direct them.  Once those wireframes were complete, they were then converted into a design using the new branding guidelines and art style to attract children to use the app more.",

        "challenges":"The main challenge was the layout of the app, as originally the product was a physical book. This meant translating what was going on in the physical to the digital. This was dealt with by using secondary functions such as swiping to add more content to a specific screen and to increase the size of the content. Another challenge was keeping the child from getting lost within the app. To overcome this the three-click rule was in place to get from the home screen to any of the stages of the app. The user flow was straight forward and easily accessible to get to their goal.",

        "outcome": "The outcome of the project was an app that I believe successfully converts from physical to digital while taking into consideration the needs of a child that will be using this app. I have learnt that designing for very contrasting users should be more focused on the one that may have difficulty using the product, in this case, the child.
